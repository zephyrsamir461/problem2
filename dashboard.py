# --- Key Findings & Actionable Insights ---
st.subheader("Key Findings & Actionable Insights")

st.markdown("""
**1. Admissions Funnel Efficiency:**
- **Finding:**
  - The dashboard shows a total of 59,400 applications, with 35,100 students admitted and 13,980 ultimately enrolled.
  - This indicates a conversion rate from application to admission of about 59%, but the yield from admitted to enrolled is only around 40%.
- **Actionable Insights:**
  - **Targeted Follow-Ups:** Enhance personalized communication with admitted students through phone calls, emails, or campus visits.
  - **Financial Incentives:** Reassess scholarship and financial aid offerings to boost enrollment among admitted students.
  - **Data Analysis:** Investigate demographic and geographic trends to identify segments with lower conversion rates and tailor recruitment strategies accordingly.

**2. Retention Rate Trends:**
- **Finding:**
  - The average retention rate across terms is 87.10%, suggesting that most enrolled students continue their studies.
  - However, some terms exhibit slight dips in retention, which might signal issues like academic challenges or insufficient student support.
- **Actionable Insights:**
  - **Early Intervention:** Implement early warning systems and academic advising for students in terms with lower retention.
  - **Enhanced Support Services:** Increase resources such as tutoring, mentoring programs, and counseling services during challenging terms.
  - **Program Review:** Examine course structures or curriculum changes that coincide with lower retention periods to identify potential improvements.

**3. Student Satisfaction Trends:**
- **Finding:**
  - Student satisfaction averages at 82.60%, with variations noted over different years.
  - Declines in satisfaction during certain periods could be linked to factors like course delivery quality, campus facilities, or student services.
- **Actionable Insights:**
  - **Deep-Dive Surveys:** Conduct detailed surveys or focus groups during low-satisfaction periods to identify specific areas for improvement.
  - **Faculty Development:** Enhance professional development programs for instructors to improve teaching effectiveness.
  - **Facility Upgrades:** Invest in campus facilities and support services to directly address areas where student feedback indicates room for improvement.
  - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a transparent process where student feedback is regularly reviewed and acted upon, with visible outcomes communicated back to the student body.

**4. Enrollment Breakdown by Department:**
- **Finding:**
  - Enrollment by department shows disparities: Arts (35.5%), Science (26.4%), Engineering (21%), and Business (17.2%).
  - The higher percentage in Arts might indicate strong interest or effective recruitment, while lower enrollments in Business and Engineering may suggest opportunities for growth.
- **Actionable Insights:**
  - **Department-Specific Marketing:** Increase marketing and outreach efforts for departments with lower enrollments, particularly Business and Engineering.
  - **Curriculum Innovation:** Review and modernize program offerings in underperforming departments to better align with market demands.
  - **Interdisciplinary Programs:** Consider creating interdisciplinary programs that combine strengths from higher-enrollment areas (like Arts) with those in lower-enrollment departments.
  - **Industry Partnerships:** Develop strategic partnerships with industry to enhance the appeal and employability of graduates from Business and Engineering.

**5. Seasonal Variations â€“ Spring vs. Fall:**
- **Finding:**
  - The Spring vs. Fall comparison clearly indicates that Fall terms have significantly higher enrollment numbers compared to Spring.
  - This seasonal trend may reflect traditional application cycles or differences in student decision-making around the academic calendar.
- **Actionable Insights:**
  - **Resource Planning:** Allocate resources, faculty, and support services more heavily during Fall to manage higher enrollment.
  - **Spring Recruitment:** Develop targeted recruitment strategies for the Spring term, such as early admission incentives or flexible scheduling options.
  - **Flexible Start Dates:** Consider offering alternative or mini-term programs in Spring to attract a broader pool of students.
  - **Trend Monitoring:** Regularly review seasonal data to ensure that strategic adjustments remain aligned with evolving enrollment patterns.

**6. Departmental Trends Over Time:**
- **Finding:**
  - Analysis of departmental enrollment trends over time reveals variations that may indicate shifting student interests or changing market demands.
  - Some departments show growth while others remain static or decline, which can impact resource allocation and program planning.
- **Actionable Insights:**
  - **Longitudinal Analysis:** Continuously monitor and analyze departmental trends to identify long-term growth or decline patterns.
  - **Strategic Investment:** Invest in expanding programs within departments showing robust growth, including additional faculty hires and infrastructure improvements.
  - **Program Revitalization:** For departments with declining trends, consider curriculum updates, increased marketing efforts, or even merging programs to better meet student and industry needs.
  - **Stakeholder Engagement:** Engage with industry stakeholders, alumni, and current students to gather insights that can help reshape and modernize department offerings.

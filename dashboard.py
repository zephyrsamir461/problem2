st.markdown("""
- **Admissions Trends:**  
  The trend charts show how applications, admissions, and enrollments have changed over different terms. Sudden peaks or declines may reflect the impact of recruitment initiatives, modifications to admission criteria, or broader economic and social factors.
  
- **Retention Rates:**  
  Stable or improving retention rates generally indicate effective academic support and student services. A decline in retention, particularly during specific terms, may signal challenges such as curriculum difficulties or insufficient student engagement.
  
- **Satisfaction Scores:**  
  Trends in student satisfaction provide key insights into the overall student experience. If lower satisfaction scores coincide with drops in retention, it underscores the need to invest in quality teaching, enhanced support services, and improved campus facilities.
  
- **Seasonal Differences:**  
  Analyzing metrics by season (Spring vs. Fall) can reveal distinct patterns. For example, higher application and enrollment numbers in the Fall term might align with the high school graduation cycle, whereas the Spring term could attract a different student profile.
  
- **Correlation Insights:**  
  The dashboard also allows for exploring potential correlations between satisfaction and retention. A strong positive correlation would suggest that efforts to improve the student experience could directly enhance retention rates.
  
- **Actionable Strategies:**  
  - **Resource Allocation:** Focus on terms with lower retention and satisfaction for targeted interventions such as improved academic advising or mentorship programs.  
  - **Recruitment Tactics:** Adapt recruitment strategies based on seasonal trends to ensure a balanced and diverse student body.  
  - **Continuous Monitoring:** Regular reviews of these key performance indicators can help identify early warning signs and enable timely adjustments in policies and practices.
  
- **Long-Term Planning:**  
  The insights from this dashboard support proactive decision-making, allowing the institution to address current challenges and forecast future trends in student engagement and success.
